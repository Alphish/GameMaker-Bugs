# GameMaker Bugs
 
Please do report bugs here for problems you have found inside GameMaker and its manual; however, before submitting anything, it is essential that you carefully read the rest of this page, so that you can be sure the issue is something you need to tell us about and is not reported already.

*Note: if your problem is to do with signing-in or not seeing your correct platforms in Target Manager (even after signing-out and in again), our setup guides, or anything to do with console support, then please continue to contact our customer services team in the usual manner. Similarly, our Marketplace extensions already have their own bug databases, so do not report things here - please see the extension's documentation or its Marketplace page for the exact link you need.*

## 1. Update GmameMaker first to ensure this isn't fixed already, then review your logs and see our FAQs to confirm it's not a problem with your setup

If you're not on the current monthly release (at least - remember Betas are available also), then do not report something until you have confirmed the current release still shows the problem. This includes LTS users!

Always check your ui.log for GameMaker and your compiler log to see if they tell you this s a machine setup issue. [More info on this on our guide](https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/13150754375453#h_01HGG0W8C5P8YTKBM7J8C86CFA).

## 2. Search for any existing report before you send one - do not file a duplicate

Always search [the list of existing issues](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues) and ensure your problem is not already reported, as responding to duplicates only slows us down. You can type your search terms into the query box at the top of the page:

If your issue is already reported you are welcome to add a comment/log/sample project onto that existing report - you can also leave a thumbs up to say you have this issue as well.

<br />

## 3. Choose the correct form and fill it all in

When [submitting a bug](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/new/choose), fill in each field with all pertinent information you can provide.

Send all requested information, otherwise there will be a delay while we request what's missing. Please strongly consider sending a *small sample* project if your bug is in-game or when building specific assets in your projects.

<br />

## "Report A GameMaker Bug" tool inside GameMaker itself

You can also [submit issues directly from GameMaker's Help menu](https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/13150754375453#h_01HGE35CZ9EJW3NEK24T3TF139) (2023.8 onwards). If your sample project needs to be visible only to GameMaker staff, then the IDE tool makes this quicker/easier for you, so we would recommend that route.
