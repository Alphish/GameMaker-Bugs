## Bug Submission Process 

All new GameMaker Bugs are regularly reviewed by a multidisciplinary team here at GameMaker, with all aspects taken into consideration.

Once an issue has been reviewed it will either be rejected with a reason why or added to the backlog where anyone can vote on issues by leaving a thumbs up or thumbs down.

Votes will be periodically reviewed and, when it fits with our schedule, will be added to GameMaker.

Please note that you may not have advanced notification of your issue being worked on but it will be closed once it has been added to GameMaker.

We thank you for your feedback!
