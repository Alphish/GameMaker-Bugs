# GameMaker Bugs
 
Submit bugs here and find the issues already known about in the GameMaker IDE and Runtimes.

We value user-feedback and strive to make GameMaker the best it can be, so by submitting an issue when you find an unknown problem you can help us make Gamemaker even better.

However, before submitting any issues, please read the below information carefully.

<br />

## 1. Review your logs and see our FAQs

Antivirus clients/firewalls/proxy servers/OS account permissions can all deliberately block GameMaker from starting up, downloading your runtimes, and make project fail to build because files cannot be accessed - for these, you *likely* do not need to report it to us, as it's just your protection software doing its job. Always check your ui.log for GameMaker and see if the error tells you roughly what/where the error is and then see [our guide on how to fix permissions issues](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022953052).

External tools like console SDKs, Android Studio, Xcode, Spine, etc. must also match what [your version of GameMaker actually requires](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/227860547) otherwise your builds will often fail - you do not need to report this to us, as it's a tools issue on your machine. Check the whole of your Output window inside GameMaker (not just the final few lines!) for what/where the error is.

<br />

## 2. Search for an existing report

Always search [the list of existing issues](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues) and ensure your problem is not already known.

If it is, feel free to add a thumbs-up to indicate you have this issue or a comment/log/sample project if you have extra information you can share to help us fix the problem sooner.

You can type your search terms into the query box at the top of the page:

*Please do not knowingly make a duplicate, as responding to duplicates will not help us fix problems sooner!*

<br />

## 3. Choose the correct form and fill it in as directed

When [submitting a bug](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/new/choose), fill in each field with all pertinent information you can provide.

Send all requested information, otherwise there will be a delay while we request what's missing. (If a form says a field is required, then this is deliberate and not something we will relax.)

Please strongly consider sending a *small sample* project if your bug is in-game or when building specific assets in your projects.

### "Report A Bug" tool inside GameMaker

You can also submit issues directly from GameMaker's Help menu (2023.8 onwards). The tool will automatically gather all the files that we need to determine the issue you have encountered and will offer to include your current project.

It's up to you which method you use, as all reports/files go to the same places and follow the same processes; however, you may prefer to use the IDE tool if your sample project needs to be private and visible only to GameMaker staff.

<br />

## The Bug Submission Process 

All new bug issues are reviewed by a multidisciplinary team here at GameMaker.

As long as it has enough information for us to work with, an issue will either be closed with a comment saying why, added to an upcoming Monthly release's list of issues to be fixed, or added to the backlog for revisiting sometime in future.

Backlogged reports which gain lots of votes will be periodically reviewed and may be scheduled for an upcoming release.

Please note issues may not get detailed updates before/while being worked on, but you will see it is Closed once the change has been made *in our internal codebase*. GameMaker's release notes will confirm when a version with that change in it becomes available to you.

We thank you for your feedback!
