        For any GameMaker IDE issues please submit an [IDE Bug](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=ide-bug&projects=&template=ide_bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+).
        Please also ensure you have searched for any existing reports of this issue before you begin - if one exists, please leave a thumbs-up, etc., rather than knowingly filing a duplicate report, as duplicates just slow things down.
        Note that most fields are required to be filled-in before you can submit this report, as it is all essential information which we will require in order to confirm and fix your issue.
