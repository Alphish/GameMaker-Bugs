## Misc New Functions

- `room_get_info(index,[views],[instances],[layers],[layer_elements],[tilemap_data])` - This function can be used to get all the information on a room. It returns a struct that contains data that has been requested, a room can be very large so this can take a long time to complete, and optionally some data can be omitted to speed it up. NOTE: Tilemap data is an array of all the tilemap indices stored as a one dimensional array of width * height, where an x, y entry is indexed as (y*width)+x
- `dbg_slider_int(dbgref,[minimum],[maximum],[label])` - Creates a slider for an integer value within the current debug section, minimum and maximum values can be specified. NOTE: if no section is declared a "Default" section will be created.
- `dbg_add_font_glyphs(filename,[size],[fontRange])` - Adds TTF font to be used in the debug rendering, font should be added to the included files, size of the font can be specified in pixels, and a font range can be selected (glyphs must be present in the given TTF font) * -1 - Default Latin range, * 0 - Greek, * 1 - Korean, * 2 - Japanese, * 3 - Chinese Full, * 4 - Chinese Simplified Common, * 5 - Cyrillic, * 6 - Thai, * 7 - Vietnamese
- `texturegroup_get_names()` - With this function you can retrieve the names of all the texturegroups contained in the game.

## Misc New Constants

height : The height of the whole tile set texture (in pixels).,
texture : The texture ID.,
tile_width : The width of a single tile (in pixels).,
tile_height : The height of a single tile (in pixels).,
tile_horizontal_separator : The number of pixels horizontally on each side of each tile (making the space between two tiles 2 * tile_horizontal_separator).,
tile_vertical_separator : The number of pixels vertically on each side of each tile (making the space between two tiles 2 * tile_vertical_separator),
tile_columns : The number of columns on each row of the tile set.,
tile_count : The number of tiles.,
frame_count : The number of frames of animation per animation.,
frame_length_ms : The number of milliseconds for frame animation.,
frames : A struct containing all the animation frames. Each tile number has a key in the struct, each entry is an array of the frames to use (each array should be frame_count long).
}
