## IDE Featured Changes

- **Changes to where Windows IDE saves your projects**
    - The Preferences default for where GameMaker stores your projects has now been moved, as Windows IDE users are increasingly opting-in (sometimes unknowingly) to OneDrive managing their "My Documents" folder and so OneDrive is causing problems when trying to save changes to a project or when trying to do builds later on [#4372](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4372)
    - {% include note.html content="If you have _not_ manually set a different home folder in Preferences, then your Preferences will automatically update to this new value when you start GameMaker; if you _have_ previously changed your home folder, then you may wish to check it is not inside OneDrive, etc." %}
    - Carrying on from the change above, if GameMaker detects your project is still being stored in a folder which is managed by OneDrive/Dropbox/Google Drive/iCloud, then you will get dialogs on save/load which advise you that you really should move your projects to the new, safe location [#2859](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2859)

- **Updated Release Notes Process**
    - Release Notes links on the Help menu and the "Update Available" notification are now updated to point at these new release notes pages [#5204](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5204)

- **Redefine Keys and other misc UI/UX changes**
    - A large number of Redefine Keys issues and general "hotkeys" bugs have been fixed, so please do see the milestone page for the full list, but here's a handful of the top-reported or most important ones...
    - Debugger: F2 to rename a watch no longer instead renames the "Variables" dock tab [#5080](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5080)
    - Room Editor: Shift-clicking no longer cancels "select from any layer" mode every time you do the command [#2463](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2463)
    - Room Editor: F2 to rename a layer in the panel no longer instead renames the Inspector tab [#2665](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2665)
    - Room Editor: Shift-clicking no longer cancels "select from any layer" mode every time you do the command [#2890](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2890)
    - UI/UX: [Mac IDE] File > Recent Projects when another project is already open now/again reliably opens the chosen project [#5508](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5508)
 
- **Stability and Performance**
    - Game Options: Fixed a GM crash when setting a .gif file as Windows splash screen and clicking Apply (note that you will not get an animated splash screen if you supply a .gif - only the first frame will be used!) [#5048](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5048)
    - Preferences: Fixed a GM crash on startup if any "Paths" field was left blank and saved in the last IDE session (Preferences now also blocks adding a blank path and will revert the path back to the default) [#5488](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5488)
    - Room Editor: Removed unexpected extra project autosaves whenever pressing "delete" and "copy" shortcuts (which can greatly improve performance/productivity in larger projects) [#5320](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5320)

- **Project Save/Load Fixes**
    - A very important project-saving fix for converting a pre-2024.2 project in 2024.2 (or 2024.400 Beta 1) when your "Default" configuration is not the active one in the IDE would overwrite your Default configuration's Game Options
    - Project Saving: Fixed an issue where duplicated Sequences were sometimes empty and could not be edited thereafter, but this was later found to affect AnimCurves, regular Sprites, and Objects also, so this is a very important fix! [#4990](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4990)
    - Project Save: Only in "Blank Game" templates on the Start Page is the default room in that project resized to match your Preferences value for the default size of a new room, as this caused the other Templates to not look/work correctly []()
    - Project Save: Renamed resources are now resorted alphabetically in the .yyp [#5035](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5035)
    - Project Save: Stopped adding the "...\_stripN" suffix onto the new Sprite assets created when dropping strip images onto GameMaker [#2963](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2963)
 
- **Git .ignore Files now added automatically when creating projects**
    - Default .gitignore files are now added into new projects when you create them, so that files only intended per-user within teams are not checked into your repositories [#2922](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2922) / [#4559](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4559) 

- **Misc Editor Changes**
    - Game Options: [iOS] No longer rejects icon images which contain transparency [#4617](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4617)
    - Image Editor: Auto-Trim command now also adjusts the sprite's collision mask to maintain the original relative position [#4873](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4873)
    - Local Packages can now be created even when logged-out (when using a "guest" account) [#4417](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4417)
    - Preferences: Can now define the default Animation Speed value for Sprites on an Asset layer in a room [#2931](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2831)
    - Texture Group Editor: Changing values for "Custom Options" now correctly forces the asset compiler to rebuild those textures (so be aware your next build may take longer, etc.) [#5603](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5603)

- **Bug Reporter Tweaks**  
    - If you do need to send us a "Building A Project" or "In-Game" bug, you will now see you're also asked to kindly tell us which platform(s) you have confirmed are affected by the issue you want to report
    - Also, in order to avoid continued confusion, the Public/Private "Visibility" dropdown has now been removed - any files attached via the in-IDE bug reporter inside GameMaker are uploaded privately

- **iOS Privacy Support**
    - Added support for complying with Apple's new privacy requirement (ITMS-91053) through PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy [#5122](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5122)
 
- **Android "Pre-Gradle Step" added**

- **Misc changes you should be aware of**
    - audio_get_recorder_count() now correctly includes devices which contain non-Latin characters in their name (also, the Audio Recording event is now surpressed if the data failed to be read - instead, you now get an error logged telling you this) [#5124](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5124)

## Milestone Page
- [2024.4](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/milestone/10?closed=1)

<br>

## Misc New Functions

- `dbg_view_exists(view)` - Check to see if a dbg_view still exists.
- `dbg_section_exists(section)` - Check to see if a dbg_section still exists
- `gpu_get_blendequation()` - This function can be used to retrieve the current blend equation being used for drawing. The returned value will be one of the following constants (the default value is bm_eq_add):
- `gpu_get_blendequation_sepalpha()` - This function can be used to retrieve the current blend and alpha blend equations being used for drawing. The function returns a 2 element 1D array with the following elements in it:
- `gpu_set_blendequation(equation)` - When GameMaker goes to draw a pixel there is a source colour (the colour of the pixel we're going to draw) and a destination colour(the colour that's already in the pixel we're drawing to), so when determining the new colour of the pixel, the source and destination colours are calculated according to the chosen blend mode. Each component of the colours is stored as a floating point value between 0 and 1, and the new colour is calculated by multiplying each component of the source colour by some factor and by multiplying each component of destination colour by some other factor and then combining the results together component by component using a configurable equation.
- `gpu_set_blendequation_sepalpha(equation,equation_alpha)` - When GameMaker goes to draw a pixel there is a source colour (the colour of the pixel we're going to draw) and a destination colour(the colour that's already in the pixel we're drawing to), so when determining the new colour of the pixel, the source and destination colours are calculated according to the chosen blend mode. Each component of the colours is stored as a floating point value between 0 and 1, and the new colour is calculated by multiplying each component of the source colour by some factor and by multiplying each component of destination colour by some other factor and then combining the results together component by component using a configurable equation.
- `gamepad_enumerate()` - Currently only functional on Android, this function will enumerate gamepads to detect any newly added gamepads and remove any recently removed ones without the need for BLUETOOTH_CONNECT permission.
