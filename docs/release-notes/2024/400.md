<br>

## Beta 4 - [IDE 543/Runtime 562 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.4++closed%3A2024-04-02..2024-04-16)

- **IDE Featured Changes**
    - Debugger: F2 to rename a watch no longer instead renames the "Variables" dock tab [5080](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5080)
    - Docs Integration: Release Notes links on the Help menu and Update Available notification are now updated to point at these new release notes pages [5204](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5204)
    - Project Saving: Only in "Blank Game" templates on the Start Page is the default room in that project resized to match your Preferences value for the default size of a new room, as this caused the other Templates to not look/work correctly []()
    - Room Editor: Removed unexpected extra project autosaves whenever pressing "delete" and "copy" shortcuts (which can greatly improve performance/productivity in larger projects) [5320](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5320)
    - Room Editor: F2 to rename a layer in the panel no longer instead renames the Inspector tab [2665](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2665)
    - Room Editor: Shift-clicking no longer cancels "select from any layer" mode every time you do the command [2890](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2890)
    - A large number of Redefine Keys issues and general "hotkeys" bugs have been fixed
    - Plus, there have been _many_ changes/fixes for Code Editor 2 and the other dialogs it interacted with
    - And, if you do need to send us a "Building A Project" or "In-Game" bug, you will now see you're also asked to kindly tell us which platform(s) you have confirmed are affected by the issue you want to report

- **Runtime Featured Changes**
    - Building Projects: [Android] Increased the minimum supported SDK version from 16 to 21 [4459](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4459)
    - {% include note.html content="For your existing projects you may need to raise this value in Game Options yourself before trying to do any builds" %}
    - Building Projects: [Android] Fixed an issue where Extensions could cause build fails in 2024.400 runtimes because build.gradle keys were not expanded correctly [5173](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5173)
    - Building Projects: [HTML5] Fixed that sound assets were not exported on Beta Runtimes 2024.400.0.550+  [5283](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5283)
    - In-Game: Gamepads are again found on startup if built using 2024.400 runtimes, which fixes an issue in earlier 400 Betas [5327](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5327)
    - In-Game: audio_get_recorder_count() now correctly includes devices which contain non-Latin characters in their name (also, the Audio Recording event is now surpressed if the data failed to be read - instead, you now get an error logged telling you this) [5124](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5124)
    - {% include important.html content="Xbox GDK version increased - see the Required SDKs FAQ before trying to do any builds" %}

## Beta 3 - [IDE 532/Runtime 551 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.4++closed%3A2024-03-26..2024-04-01)

- **IDE Featured Changes**
    - Code Editor: The new code editor is now available for Beta users to enable in Preferences (if you wish) and try out - along with its many new features: scrollbar minimap with floating code preview tooltips, rainbow braces, all events for an object open at once in a single view, configurable layouts, and much more (see its Preferences section for more info)
    - Feather: Has now been renamed "Diagnostics" and is active when using CE2, so you will see this if you enable the new code editor (be aware that in this release you will get a _second_ panel for Diagnostics, rather than your existing "Syntax Errors"/"Feather" tab being closed when the new one opens - just close the old one)
    - Project Save: The Preferences default for where GameMaker stores your projects has now been moved, as Windows IDE users are increasingly opting-in (sometimes unknowingly) to OneDrive managing their "My Documents" folder and so OneDrive is causing problems when trying to do their builds later on [4372](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4372)
    - {% include note.html content="If you have _not_ manually set a different home folder in Preferences, then your Preferences will automatically update to this new value when you start GameMaker; if you _have_ previously changed your home folder, then you may wish to check it is not inside OneDrive, etc." %}
    - Project Save: Carrying on from the change above, if GameMaker detects your project is still being stored in a folder which is managed by OneDrive/Dropbox/Google Drive/iCloud, then you will get dialogs on save/load which advise you that you really should move your projects to the new, safe location  [2859](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2859)

- **Runtime Featured Changes**
    - In-Game: Surfaces and/or Blend modes seem broken since Runtime 2023.11.0.157 (although, the comment saying the names have now been reversed is not part of this release - it will be in the _next_ Beta) [4859](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4859)
    - {% include important.html content="Windows YYC Linker version is now always the 64bit one, so using vcvars32.bat in Preferences no longer works and you need to reset to defaults now (which has been VsDevCmd.bat for a bit) - see the Windows setup guide linked-to on the Required SDKs FAQ if you need more info" %}

## Beta 2 - [IDE 526/Runtime 547 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.4++closed%3A2024-03-13..2024-03-25)

- **IDE Featured Changes**
    - Default .gitignore files are now added into new projects when you create them (although, we are aware that right now the Mac IDE does not do this, nor does _importing_ an existing project .yyz) [2922](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2922) / [4559](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4559)
    - Project Save: Renamed resources are now resorted alphabetically in the .yyp when using 2024.2 [5035](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5035)
    - Game Options: Fixed a GM crash when setting a .gif file as Windows splash screen and clicking Apply (note that you will not get an animated splash screen if you supply a .gif - only the first frame will be used!) [5048](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5048)
    - Image Editor: Auto-Trim command now also adjusts the sprite's collision mask to maintain the original relative position [4873](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4873)
    - Also a very important project-saving fix for converting a pre-2024.2 project in 2024.2 or 2024.400 Beta 1 when your "Default" configuration is not the active one in the IDE would overwrite your Default configuration's Game Options

- **Runtime Featured Changes**
    - In-Game: audio_play_sound() was unable to play sound in 2024.400 Beta 1 [5071](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5071)
    - In-Game: audio_is_playing(assetname) always returned true in 2024.400 Beta 1 [5050](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5050)
    - In-Game: [HTML5] event_perform_async() now performs the Social async event, so no longer differs from Windows, etc. [5078](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5078)
    - {% include important.html content="PS5 SDK version increased - see the Required SDKs FAQ before trying to do any builds" %}

## Milestone Page
- [2024.4](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/milestone/10?closed=1) (Closed issues are fixed/implemented for Betas, Open issues are still to do before the Monthly)

<br>

## Misc New Functions

- `dbg_view_exists(view)` - Check to see if a dbg_view still exists.
- `dbg_section_exists(section)` - Check to see if a dbg_section still exists
- `gpu_get_blendequation()` - This function can be used to retrieve the current blend equation being used for drawing. The returned value will be one of the following constants (the default value is bm_eq_add):
- `gpu_get_blendequation_sepalpha()` - This function can be used to retrieve the current blend and alpha blend equations being used for drawing. The function returns a 2 element 1D array with the following elements in it:
- `gpu_set_blendequation(equation)` - When GameMaker goes to draw a pixel there is a source colour (the colour of the pixel we're going to draw) and a destination colour(the colour that's already in the pixel we're drawing to), so when determining the new colour of the pixel, the source and destination colours are calculated according to the chosen blend mode. Each component of the colours is stored as a floating point value between 0 and 1, and the new colour is calculated by multiplying each component of the source colour by some factor and by multiplying each component of destination colour by some other factor and then combining the results together component by component using a configurable equation.
- `gpu_set_blendequation_sepalpha(equation,equation_alpha)` - When GameMaker goes to draw a pixel there is a source colour (the colour of the pixel we're going to draw) and a destination colour(the colour that's already in the pixel we're drawing to), so when determining the new colour of the pixel, the source and destination colours are calculated according to the chosen blend mode. Each component of the colours is stored as a floating point value between 0 and 1, and the new colour is calculated by multiplying each component of the source colour by some factor and by multiplying each component of destination colour by some other factor and then combining the results together component by component using a configurable equation.
- `gamepad_enumerate()` - Currently only functional on Android, this function will enumerate gamepads to detect any newly added gamepads and remove any recently removed ones without the need for BLUETOOTH_CONNECT permission.
