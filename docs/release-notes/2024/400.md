- IDE Featured Changes
    - Default .gitignore files are now added into new projects when you create them _using the Windows IDE_ (although, not if you open or import an existing project!) [2922](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2922) / [4559](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4559)
    - Project Save: Renamed resources aren't resorted alphabetically in the .yyp when using 2024.2 [5035](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5035)
    - Game Options: GM crash when setting a .gif file as Windows splash screen and clicking Apply (note that you will not get an animated splash screen if you supply a .gif - only the first frame will be used!) [5048](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5048)
    - Image Editor: Auto-Trim command doesn't also adjust the sprite's collision mask to maintain the original relative position [4873](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4873)
    - Also a very important project-saving fix for converting a pre-2024.2 project in 2024.2 or 2024.400 Beta 1 when your "Default" configuration is not the active one in the IDE would overwrite your Default configuration's Game Options
